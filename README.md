⚠️ Disclaimer:
The code in this repository was developed by my professors as part of an academic research project during my M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. I do not claim authorship of the code. It is shared here solely for academic presentation purposes — to demonstrate the research problem, the solution architecture, and the experiments I studied.

My role was to understand the theoretical concepts such as reinforcement learning (RL), Soft Q-Networks (SQN), and self-supervised learning (SSL), and to grasp how these were applied to sparse reward scenarios in recommendation systems. I can explain the high-level idea and outcome, but not the technical implementation in detail.
